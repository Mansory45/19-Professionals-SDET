What is PolyMorphism:
    PolyMorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the
    object or parameters that we pass to a method.
    When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently then it is called.
    static PolyMorphism or compile time PolyMorphism or early binding.
    when we achieve the PolyMorphism through method overriding then it is called 
    dynamic binding or run time PolyMorphism or late binding.

   Why we should use PolyMorphism:
   1) cleaner code.
   2) we never prefer to change the exsiting code if we want to imporve somting we alwasy
   want to create new method and new class.  we can call these method using the parent class variable/ reference.
   3) we can call muliple method from many class with the help of single variable.
   Like we can create the array of objects and with the help of a  loop will be able
   to call the method form all the class.
 How can we call PolyMorphism?
 1) Create a parent child relationship.
 2) override the method in the child classes.
 3) create the array of all the child classobjects and with the help of loop you can call all the method froma the child classes.
 Rules:
 1)All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the PolyMorphism.
 2)we can store the object of a child class inside a  reference variable of type parent class but we can't do the reverse.
 3) we can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold the objects of child classess.
