what is an interface:
    Interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class are bublic static final (constants)
    and all the methods by defualt are also public .
Why  we should learn about the interface:
    we can implement abstraction using interfaces.
    when class are logically connected to each other and we want to have instance fields and implemented
    method as well while doing abstraction then we should go with abstract class

How can I use an interface
    we use interface kewyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract method .

Rules:
   1) All the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
   2)No instance fields mean no constractor is required.
   3)No instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract.
   4)When we implements the methods from the interface we use implements kewyword.
   5)Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in java.
   6) An interface can extend another interface.

  What is Encapsulation in Java:
   Encapsulation is the 4th oillar of OOPs. It is a mechanism that provides us security. If we use encapsulation we can have more security
  How we should use Encapsulation:
    1) make your variable as private .
    2) Create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields.
