What is abstraction:
--Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and only
  Showing the functionality. It's the 3rd pilar of OOps.

Why we should use Abstraction?
    1)It reduces the complexity by separating the ideas form implementations.
    2) we can also enforce rules on other classes.
How can we use the abstraction:
    we can use abstraction in our code with the help of abstract classes and interfaces.
    we create abstract methods with only the header and mark the class as abstract now
    every class that will be inheriting from this class will either implement those methods or
    mark the child class abstract as well.
Rules:
    1) Abstract methods can't have a body .
    2) As soon as we have one abstract method in a class that class must be declared as abstract.
    3) once a class inherit from an abstract class that class must implement the abstract method
    or it should be marked as abstract.
    4) we can have normal method with body and abstract methods inside a class.
    5) we can't create the objects of abstract classes.
    6) abstract classes can't be declared final classes.
    7) we can have everything inside an abstract class that we can have in a normal class.
    the only thing that differs is we can't create the object of that class.
